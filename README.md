# 📄 Claude PDF RAG Chatbot

An end-to-end **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** application that allows users to upload PDF documents and ask natural-language questions, with answers generated by **Anthropic Claude** and grounded strictly in retrieved document context.

👉 **Live Demo:**  
https://claude-pdf-rag-chatbot.streamlit.app/

This project demonstrates a **production-ready, deployable document QA system** built with modern LLM tooling and designed to run reliably on Streamlit Cloud.

## 🔍 Use Case

- Ask questions about research papers, reports, or internal documents  
- Extract precise answers without manual document searching  
- Provide **source-aware, transparent responses** to increase trust  

This pattern is applicable to:
- Enterprise knowledge bases  
- Compliance & policy review  
- Research and analyst workflows

## 🧠 System Architecture (RAG Pipeline)

The application follows a standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation flow:

1. **PDF Ingestion**  
   Users upload one or more PDF documents via the Streamlit UI.

2. **Chunking**  
   Documents are split into overlapping text chunks using recursive character splitting.

3. **Embedding**  
   Text chunks are embedded using a Hugging Face sentence-transformer model.

4. **Vector Search (FAISS)**  
   Relevant chunks are retrieved via FAISS similarity search (no database persistence).

5. **Answer Generation**  
   Claude generates answers **only from retrieved context**, preventing hallucination.

6. **Source Display**  
   The app shows source document names, page numbers, and excerpts alongside answers.

## 🧩 Key Technologies

- **Streamlit** – Interactive chat-based UI  
- **LangChain** – Document loading, chunking, and retrieval orchestration  
- **FAISS** – In-memory vector store for fast and reliable similarity search  
- **Hugging Face Embeddings** – `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`  
- **Anthropic Claude** – LLM for grounded answer generation  

> FAISS is used instead of ChromaDB to ensure **stable deployment on Streamlit Cloud**
> without SQLite or filesystem persistence issues.
